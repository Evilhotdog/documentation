# 3. Scaling & Monetisation

This article usually gets a revision every few months as we progress, so it may not always be up to date.

To start answering this question:
- Revolt is already pretty efficient and can theoretically also scale both vertically and horizontally.
- Problem areas are currently being worked on and a lot of progress has been made already (Example Issue: [#105](https://github.com/revoltchat/delta/issues/105)).
- Revolt is also incredibly inexpensive to run, as of 12th November, Revolt is still running on a single node and coping fine although we are soon due either an upgrade or to scale horizontally.

Now you may be asking how will Revolt be funded?
- We have a variety of monetisation ideas lined up internally, **none of which involve paywalling features**!
- We currently have £1616 in donations (as of 12th November) from our community, of which only £60 has been spent to run the service (12th November).
- Given everything I've seen so far, it's likely some of the monetisation strategies we thought of are likely to succeed, some will also allow us to support community members who create awesome things.
